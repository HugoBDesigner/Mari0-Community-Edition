***The open-source, community-driven counterpart to Alesan's Entities***

(If you don't know what this game is, it's classic Mario Bros. but with a portal gun. It's fun. Play it.)

You can run the .love files found in the [Release](https://github.com/Mari0-CE/Mari0-Community-Edition/releases/tag/1.4) using **LÃ¶ve**, which can be found here for [Windows,](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-11.1-win64.exe) [Mac,](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/love-11.1-macos.zip) [or whatever other platform.](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/ "Use 0.11.1")

If you're looking for help or mappacks, or you made a mappack of your own, [the game's forum is here.](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewforum.php?f=8&sid=22f68690172a445d290d953b52074c83)
